## Adobe Skills for AI Coding Agents

Repository of Adobe skills for AI coding agents.

## Installation

### Claude Code Plugins

```
/plugin marketplace add adobe/skills
/plugin install adobe-analytics@adobe-skills
/plugin install adobe-cja@adobe-skills
/plugin install aem-design@adobe-skills
/plugin install aem-edge-delivery-services@adobe-skills
/plugin install aem-project-management@adobe-skills
/plugin install app-builder@adobe-skills
/plugin install aem-cloud-service@adobe-skills

/plugin install workfront@adobe-skills
/plugin install commerce-app-management@adobe-skills
/plugin install commerce-app-migration@adobe-skills
/plugin install commerce-app-review@adobe-skills
```

### Vercel Skills (npx skills)

```
npx skills add adobe/skills --all
```

### upskill (GitHub CLI Extension)

```
gh extension install ai-ecoverse/gh-upskill
gh upskill adobe/skills --all
```

### Cursor (preview)

The `app-builder` plugin includes a Cursor-native manifest at `plugins/app-builder/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` as the pilot for Cursor distribution. Other plugins will gain Cursor support once the pattern is validated. To install locally for development:

```
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local/app-builder
cp -R plugins/app-builder/. ~/.cursor/plugins/local/app-builder/
# Then in Cursor: Cmd+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window
```

Verify the plugin loaded via **Cursor Settings → Plugins** (it should appear with the App Builder skills, including the grouped `appbuilder-workfront` suite). The skills are also visible in **Settings → Rules** under "Agent Decides".

## Available Skills

### App Builder

Development, customization, testing, and deployment skills for Adobe App Builder projects.

**Skill chaining:**

- **Actions path:** `appbuilder-project-init` → `appbuilder-action-scaffolder` → `appbuilder-testing` → `appbuilder-cicd-pipeline`
- **UI path:** `appbuilder-project-init` → `appbuilder-ui-scaffolder` → `appbuilder-testing` → `appbuilder-cicd-pipeline`
- **E2E path:** `appbuilder-ui-scaffolder` or `appbuilder-testing` → `appbuilder-e2e-testing` → `appbuilder-cicd-pipeline`

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `appbuilder-project-init` | Initialize App Builder projects and choose the bootstrap path; also first-time machine/CLI setup (Node 20, aio install/login, stage vs prod) |
| `appbuilder-action-scaffolder` | Scaffold, implement, deploy, and debug Adobe Runtime actions |
| `appbuilder-ui-scaffolder` | Generate React Spectrum UI components for ExC Shell SPAs and AEM UI Extensions |

| `appbuilder-cicd-pipeline` | Set up CI/CD pipelines for GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and GitLab CI |

### App Builder — Workfront UI Extensions

Skills for building customized **Workfront** UI applications on Adobe App Builder — a React/Spectrum SPA embedded through Workfront extension points, backed by Adobe I/O Runtime actions that call the Workfront / Planning / Adobe APIs. Shipped as part of the `app-builder` plugin under `plugins/app-builder/skills/appbuilder-workfront/`, as a parent umbrella skill plus three sub-skills. Machine setup and `aio app init` live in `appbuilder-project-init`.

> **Usage guide:** [`plugins/app-builder/USAGE.md`](https://github.com/adobe/skills/blob/main/plugins/app-builder/USAGE.md) is the end-to-end walkthrough for driving these skills from an AI harness — set up the `aio` CLI → build a new project (or migrate existing code) → deploy → publish — with the start point, harness wiring, the questions the AI will ask, copy-paste prompts, and the gotchas to watch for.

**Journey:** `appbuilder-project-init` (set up + scaffold) → `workfront-ui-extension` + `workfront-actions` (build) → `workfront-local-testing` (test) → deploy & publish. Start at the **`appbuilder-workfront`** umbrella for the end-to-end map.

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `appbuilder-workfront` | Umbrella / onboarding: the end-to-end roadmap and how the SPA, actions, and extension points fit; routes to the three sub-skills below |
| `workfront-ui-extension` | Front-end SPA: extension points (Main Menu, per-object left panel, widgets), routing, shared context, `actionWebInvoke` |
| `workfront-actions` | Runtime actions: `{data,error}` shape, IMS auth passthrough, inputs/config, CommonJS, and the Workfront Public API v21 (search/count, bulk PUT, custom `DE:` fields) |
| `workfront-local-testing` | Preview a local (`extensionOverride`) or deployed (Extension Manager BYO) build inside Workfront; fix common "not showing" issues |

### Commerce

Skills that ease developing and integrating with Adobe Commerce alongside other Adobe products.

#### Commerce App Management

Scaffold and configure Adobe Commerce App Builder apps using the `aio-commerce-sdk`. `commerce-app-init` scaffolds a bare app with metadata only; domain skills then extend it one concern at a time.

#### Commerce App Review

Self-review skill for developers and partners to check an Adobe Commerce App Builder app against the submission guidelines before submitting to Adobe Exchange.

```
/plugin install commerce-app-review@adobe-skills
```

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `commerce-app-review` | Reviews a local app directory against Adobe's Commerce submission guidelines and walks through each finding interactively |
